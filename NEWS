odpc 2.0.0
==============

* The higher order ODPC are now defined as linear combinations of the observations (instead of linear combinations of the residuals of the previous fits). This way
a smaller number of observations is lost when new components are added. The forecasting performance of the new definition is very similar to that of the old one.
* Option to use gdpc as starting point for the iterations is no longer supported (for now).
* Added functions to automate the choice of the tuning parameters for odpc: cv.odpc is based on minimizing the cross-validated forecasting error, crit.odpc
is based on minimizing and information criterion.
* Added several tests.
